Evaluating Meta LLaMA 3.1 Inference on NVIDIA A100 (40GB & 80GB) vs. NVIDIA H100 80GB

As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, deploying them efficiently for inference becomes increasingly important. With models like LLaMA 3.1 (70B), the choice of hardware can significantly impact both performance and resource utilization, especially when handling complex tasks involving long context windows. In this post, we’ll explore how both NVIDIA A100 40GB and 80GB compare with NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs in terms of memory usage, performance, and inference speed. Using long-context scenarios, we'll examine single and multi-GPU setups for optimal model deployment.

Understanding GPU Configurations and Memory-Efficient Loading

Before diving into the analysis, it’s essential to understand that loading large models on GPUs requires memory-efficient techniques to manage VRAM effectively. By employing strategies like sequential loading and meta-device usage, we can reduce peak memory demands, which can allow a 70B model like LLaMA to fit within the available GPU memory. These methods become especially valuable for GPUs with limited VRAM, such as the NVIDIA A100 40GB. 

Comparing GPU Configurations: NVIDIA A100 40GB, NVIDIA A100 80GB, Single NVIDIA H100 80GB, and Multiple NVIDIA H100 80GB

The following sections compare these configurations based on three main criteria:
1. Memory Usage
2. Relative Performance
3. Inference Speed

 1. Memory Usage and Relative Performance

The memory usage of each configuration is a critical factor for inference tasks. Larger VRAM capacity allows for higher batch sizes and longer context windows, making the NVIDIA A100 80GB and NVIDIA H100 80GB better suited for large models compared to the NVIDIA A100 40GB. However, NVIDIA H100s have architectural advantages that go beyond just VRAM size, including faster memory bandwidth and improved computational power.

Here’s a comparative bar chart for memory usage and relative performance across different configurations:

Fig 1

NVIDIA A100 40GB: Shows limited memory and performance due to its VRAM capacity, making it less suitable for large model inference with long context windows.
NVIDIA A100 80GB: Offers more VRAM, allowing better performance for large models but still limited compared to NVIDIA H100 configurations.
Single NVIDIA H100 80GB: Higher performance and memory handling capability thanks to its advanced architecture.
Multiple NVIDIA H100 80GB: Provides the best performance and memory distribution, making it ideal for production-scale LLM deployments.


 2. The Impact of Different Datasets: The Pile vs. Wikipedia

Using datasets like The Pile or Wikipedia introduces variability in memory and performance requirements. For example, The Pile includes longer, diverse content, resulting in higher memory usage and slightly lower inference speeds due to its complexity. In contrast, Wikipedia’s more concise structure tends to require fewer tokens and memory.

Below is a tailored visualization that shows how these datasets affect each GPU configuration:

Fig 2

The Pile Dataset: Increases memory usage and highlights the differences in performance, especially between single and multi-GPU setups. This is due to the dataset’s diverse content, which adds to computational complexity.
Wikipedia Dataset: Shows lower memory usage overall, as Wikipedia's shorter entries require fewer tokens, resulting in smaller performance differences between single and multi-GPU configurations.

3. Inference Speed with Long Context Windows

For real-world LLM applications, long context windows are increasingly important, as they enable the model to handle complex inputs and retain substantial context throughout inference. We’ve assumed a hypothetical context window of 4096 input tokens and 512 output tokens to examine how each GPU setup performs with longer sequences.

Here’s a bar chart comparing the inference speeds for each configuration under these conditions:

NVIDIA A100 40GB: Takes the longest time to complete inference, as it is constrained by both VRAM and compute power.
NVIDIA A100 80GB: Improved inference speed due to additional memory but still slower than the NVIDIA H100 due to architectural limitations.
Single NVIDIA H100 80GB: Significantly faster, benefiting from enhanced memory bandwidth and computational capabilities.
Multiple NVIDIA H100 80GB: Achieves the shortest inference time by efficiently distributing the workload, ideal for large-scale, long-context inference tasks.

Configuration for a Long Context Window

Context Window Settings:
•	Input Tokens: 4096 tokens
•	Output Tokens: 512 tokens
This setup represents a significant load, as handling 4096 input tokens means that the model needs to process and retain a large amount of context throughout each layer, and 512 output tokens increase the computational and memory demands on the GPU.
•	4096 Input Tokens: This value is typical for long-context tasks, like summarizing or generating responses to lengthy articles or documents, which can require many retained tokens.
•	512 Output Tokens: This is a reasonably high output length for generating extended responses, such as detailed answers or summaries, that would showcase the differences in inference speed across different GPU setups.

Conclusion

The choice of GPU configuration has a substantial impact on the efficiency of large language models like LLaMA 3.1. With the NVIDIA A100 series, the 80GB model can handle longer contexts better than the 40GB model, but NVIDIA H100 GPUs excel due to their improved architecture and memory handling. Multiple NVIDIA H100 GPUs provide the best performance and flexibility for long-context inference, allowing large models to fully leverage their capabilities.

Summary:
Single NVIDIA A100 GPUs may suffice for moderate tasks but will struggle with extensive contexts.
Single NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs offer a considerable performance boost and better manage long contexts.
Multiple NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs are optimal for demanding, production-scale inference tasks, especially with long context windows.

Whether you’re processing vast amounts of text from The Pile or concise entries from Wikipedia, leveraging the right GPU setup can make all the difference in maximizing your LLM's potential.
